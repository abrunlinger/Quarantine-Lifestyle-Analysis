# Quarantine-Lifestyle-Analysis
Capstone project for my analysis of Nashville community member lifestyle habits and outlook on life

# The Data
All of the data was sourced from 2 locations: 
  * The US Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplements report (https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.html) for 2019 
  * A survey I created in Microsoft forms that was given to 116 self-selected subjects from the Nashville tech community

# The Tools
Microsoft Forms - curate and host the survey, exporting the results as a .CSV
Excel - Inferred questions and answers were added to the dataset
Python - Datasets were joined, cleaned, and correlated
Power BI - Visualizations were created from the final dataset 

# The Questions
How do lifestyle habits, income, and environment affect your Outlook?
  * Identify any strongly correlated values in the data
  * Compare/contrast the lifestyles of those from different outlooks
  * Outline the relationship between income, age, and outlook

# The Process
I approached the dataset by joining the data from my survey to the census data so income could be quickly applied to correlations. Once that was finished, I began mapping the correlations of all values in the data with all other values to identify strong correlations.
